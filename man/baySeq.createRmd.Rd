\title{Generate a \code{.Rmd} file containing code to perform differential expression analysis with baySeq}
\usage{
baySeq.createRmd(data.path, result.path, codefile, norm.method, equaldisp,
  sample.size = 5000, estimation = "QL", pET = "BIC")
}
\arguments{
\item{data.path}{The path to a .rds file containing the \code{compData} object that will be used for the differential expression analysis.}

\item{result.path}{The path to the file where the result object will be saved.}

\item{codefile}{The path to the file where the code will be written.}

\item{norm.method}{The between-sample normalization method used to compensate for varying library sizes and composition in the differential expression analysis. Possible values are \code{"quantile"}, \code{"total"} and \code{"edgeR"}.}

\item{equaldisp}{Logical parameter indicating whether or not equal dispersion should be assumed across all conditions.}

\item{sample.size}{The size of the sample used to estimate the priors (default 5000).}

\item{estimation}{The approach used to estimate the priors. Possible values are \code{"QL"} (default), \code{"ML"} and \code{"edgeR"}.}

\item{pET}{The method used to re-estimate the priors. Possible values are \code{"BIC"} (default), \code{"none"} and \code{"iteratively"}.}
}
\value{
The function generates a \code{.Rmd} file containing the code for performing the differential expression analysis. This file can be executed using e.g. the \code{knitr} package.
}
\description{
A function to generate code that can be run to perform differential expression analysis of RNAseq data (comparing two conditions) using the \code{baySeq} package. The code is written to a \code{.Rmd} file. This function is generally not called by the user, the main interface for performing differential expression analysis is the \code{\link{runDiffExp}} function.
}
\details{
For more information about the methods and the interpretation of the parameters, see the \code{baySeq} package and the corresponding publications.

\examples{
try(
if (require(baySeq)) {
tmpdir <- normalizePath(tempdir(), winslash = "/")
SyntheticDataSimulation(simul.data= 'KIRC', dataset = file.path(tmpdir, "mydata.rds"), n.var = 500,
                                    samples.per.cond = 3, n.diffexp = 100, dispType='same', mode='D',
                                    fraction.upregulated=0.5, dataset.parameters=generateDatasetParameter())
## Note! In the interest of speed, we set sample.size=10 in this example.
## In a real analysis, much larger sample sizes are recommended (the default is 5000).

           equaldisp = TRUE, sample.size = 10)
